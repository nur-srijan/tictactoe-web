  - 3x3: Classic game with traditional rules
  - 4x4: Advanced version requiring 4 in a row
  - 5x5: Expert mode with enhanced winning conditions
- Intelligent AI opponent using minimax algorithm
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Modern user interface with animations
- Game state tracking
- Real-time win detection
- Easy reset functionality
- Light and Dark modes synchronysied with your system theme (**New**)
